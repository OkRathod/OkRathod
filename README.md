# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The error you're encountering, **"Invalid typed array length: 24"**, typically happens when thereâ€™s an issue with the size or structure of the buffer data (like vertex positions or indices) in the glTF model, causing Three.js to attempt to create a `Float32Array` of invalid size.

### Possible causes and solutions:

1. **Corrupt or Invalid glTF Export**:
   - **Solution**: Double-check your Blender export settings. Make sure that the glTF export is valid and includes proper attributes (e.g., vertex positions, normals, indices). Try re-exporting the file using default settings if you're customizing options.

2. **Mismatched Accessor Length**:
   - If the `accessor` in the glTF file doesn't match the actual buffer data, it could lead to the engine trying to allocate an invalid length.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the `accessors` in the glTF file correctly map to the right `bufferViews` and that the `count` values are correct. 

3. **Wrong Data Type or Incomplete Data**:
   - Sometimes, using the wrong data type or having incomplete data (like a missing buffer or corrupted Base64 data) can cause this error.
   - **Solution**: Verify that the `bufferViews` and `accessors` have valid data types and all necessary data for the mesh (e.g., positions, indices).

### Debugging Steps:
1. **Test with a Simpler Model**:
   - Try loading a simple `.glb` file (like a basic cube) that you know works, to see if the issue is with the Three.js code or the specific model.

2. **Check Console Output**:
   - Check the network tab or logs to ensure the `.gltf` or `.glb` file is being loaded correctly and the data isn't truncated.

3. **Update Libraries**:
   - Ensure you're using the latest version of Three.js and `GLTFLoader`. Sometimes, bugs in older versions of libraries can cause such issues.

4. **Validate the glTF File**:
   - Use an online [glTF Validator](https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Validator/) to check if the file has any issues or inconsistencies.

If the error persists after these steps, feel free to share more details about your model or setup, and I can assist you further!
